1. Introduction to functions.
-> The concept of functions came into existence to support the way we organize and
   structure code. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and
   can be reused throughout the program.
   
   This allows us to write more efficient and modular code, as well as the ability
   to easily update or change the behavior of the program by modifying the functions.
   Additionally, by using functions we can make the code more readable and easier
   to understand.

   Some functions will be in-built in javascript which can be directly used and Some
   must be user-defined functions. We will be looking into them in further lectures.

3. Advantages of using functions.

    (i) Functions allows us to define a block of code once and reuse it mutlitple times
        throughout your program. So we need not to repeat the same lines of code every
        time.
    (ii)While solving a problem we split them into subproblems so we could solve smaller
        problems to achieve the final result. Here functions can be used to break down
        complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.
    (iii)Functions can make code more readable by giving it a clear structure and making
        it easy to understand what the code is doing.
    (iv)Functions are tested separately before actual implementation. Because functions
        can be tested and debugged independently of the rest of the code, it can make it
        easier to identify and fix bugs.
    (v) Functions are the optimal way to manage the space which leads to higher performance
        of the program.
